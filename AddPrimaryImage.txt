Here are the requirements for adding a primary image to a business card:

It will be available to both pro and non pro users
Users should be able to upload an image from the card from. 
If an image is uploaded, it will then be visible in the business card display aligned to the right of the business card header.
The image should be circle, like a typical profile picture image from social media. 
If someone deletes the image, it should also be removed from card display.


The images will be stored in Firebase Storage. Below are the current rules so pay attention to the file naming. 
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /docs/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    match /images/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}

A profile image should be able to be deleted from the form.
If a new image is uploaded, the old image should be deleted from Firebase Storage.
Make sure the code doesnt also try to save the image to the users collection in Firestore.

In the form, you can place this section above the CV upload section. It should be titled "Primary Image Upload".
