When a user is no longer a pro user, we need to handle the documents they have uploaded.
As is now, users should not be able to upload a new document. They should be able to delete the existing document.
Users should get a warning that their CV will be deleted 30 days after their subscription ends.
We should have some automated way to delete the CV 30 days after the subscription ends.
