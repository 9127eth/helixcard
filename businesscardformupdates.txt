great to know. Okay I want to revampe this a bit. I want to reduce the size of the forms and text, it's just too large. Also I'd like to break them into sections and group them, maybe each section can have 2 columns of input fields to make for better visually appealing, first section will be basic informtion, his would include things like name, credentials, about me, pronouns, next section would be contact information for things like phone number and email. Then there will be a social links section. And at the bottom would be the custom message and document upload.
