Each card on grid should now have share button. Again this button will only be located on cards that you view from the dashboard.

Once share button is clicked, it should open a modal that should be mobile friendly. The modal will have a qr code at the top pointing to the url of the card.

At the top of the qr code should be 'Digital Business Card' in a standard font.

The modal should have a close button on the bottom right.

Under the qr code, there should be a section that displays the url of the card along with a button to copy the url to the clipboard. 

The modal should have a download button on the bottom right to be able to download the qr code. There should be the option to download it as a jpeg, png, or svg, with png being the default. There should also be a transparent background option for each file type.

under the copy url button should be a button to "preview in browser"

When this modal pops up, everything in the background should be grayed out, as if the page is transitioning to this modal.
