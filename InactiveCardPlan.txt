I need to implement making non primary cards inactive if the user firestore "isPro" status is false. There is already a way to cancel subs so we do not need to make any changes to our stripe integration.
All of this logic should only be tied to the firebase "isPro" status. We should not add any new fields (other than "isActive") or anything like that if not absolutely necessary.
When a user cancels and the firestore changes to isPro=false I want a few things to happen, but I want this to be tied to the firebase changed isPro to false. 
The dashboard should show non primary cards as inactive. 
Provide messaging to inform the user that these cards are inactive and require a subscription to reactivate.
Users will be able to edit and save cards as normal. 
Also, we can disable the share button  on the grid and give to pro message.
The URL for an inactive card should still be accessible but, it should have a pop up message saying "This card is no longer active." This pop up should have a button to create a new free card.
Implement this in a straightforward way that only changes the necessary code to implement the functionality. Nothing else. this is my first time coding.
